# Status Logger

_âš¡ a Sparkmate Let's Build brick (lib) âš¡_

A more advanced status logger that makes logging and status reporting easier. Includes features:

- Log to Serial and to a recallable buffer
- Report the status of various bricks within your code (your sensors, actuators, components, etc.)
- Recall important logs and statusses at a later time
- Pipe logs and statuses to other Streams, e.g. a file on the SD card

## Usage

```cpp
    /* Print a brick status into a Serial readible format. */
    String deconstructBrickStatus(BRICK_STATUS brick_status);

    /* Log something to the StatusLogger system.
     *  If the (log) level is less than LOG_LEVEL_SAVE then we'll print both to Serial and to the cacher to be retrieved later (use sparingly)! */
    void log(LOG_LEVEL_td level, String device, String msg, bool print_to_serial = false, Stream *stream = &Serial);

    /* Retrieve logs previously cached (good for log dumps of important logs as opposed to just Serial.print). */
    void retrieveLogs(Stream *stream = &Serial);

    /* Update a brick's status (for example if internet failed), options of: [FUNCTIONAL, PARTIAL, OFFLINE]. Automatically makes a log status update. */
    void setBrickStatus(String device, LOG_FUNCTIONALITY_td functionality, String msg = "");

    /* Retrieve all of the latest brick statuses and print to logs (default is Serial) */
    void printBrickStatuses(Stream *stream = &Serial);

    /* Set the session details at the beginning of operation. Set once and forget! */
    void setSessionDetails(String device_ID, String session_filename, time_t session_start_time);

    /* Print only the session details to Serial */
    void printSessionDetails();

```
